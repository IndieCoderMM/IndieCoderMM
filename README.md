# Hi there, 🖐
I'm a self-taught programmer from Myanmar. I enjoy learning programming and creating my own projects and games. I also like to share my experiences with others and so I'm running a wordpress blog on indiecodermm.tech.blog where I write about programming-related articles. You can check out my facebook page at facebook.com/indiecodingschool.
