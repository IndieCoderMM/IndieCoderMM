# Hi there, 🖐

I'm Hein Thant, a self-taught programmer from Myanmar who loves solving problems and creating games. I'm a fan of old-school games and animation, and I believe that the best projects are created by mixing old with new.

I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and my creativity. I'm currently a full-time student at Microverse, where I collaborate with other devs from all over the world to build real-world projects.
